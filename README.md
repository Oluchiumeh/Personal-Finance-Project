# Personal Finance Tracker
## Project Overview
This Personal Finance Tracker is a comprehensive Excel-based dashboard designed to help users monitor and manage their income, expenses, and savings efficiently. Built using Power Pivot, Power Query, and interactive slicers, this project simulates a real-world scenario where multiple financial data sources are integrated, modeled, and visualized to provide actionable insights.
This is not just an Excel sheet—it's a dynamic financial management tool.

## Why This Project Matters
In today’s world, being able to tell a story with data is key. This tracker is more than just numbers—it's a clear narrative of income sources, spending habits, and savings goals. As a Data Analyst, I wanted to demonstrate:

- My ability to structure data from scratch

- Build meaningful relationships via a data model

- Present insights in a clear, interactive dashboard format

- Solve a real-world problem with storytelling and analytics

## Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel

- Power Pivot

- Power Query

- PivotTables & PivotCharts

- Slicers for interactivity

- Data Modeling

- Data Storytelling

## Project Objectives
- Track and analyze personal finances

- Build a professional dashboard for non-technical users

- Create a scalable and dynamic reporting system

- Simulate business analysis experience through personal finance

## Project Structure
### Data Collection
I manually structured five main datasets:

Income Table: Tracks all income sources, amounts, and dates

Expenses Table: Logs spending categories, vendors, and payment methods

Savings Table: Includes savings category, institution, and amounts

Date Table: Supports time-based analysis

Category Table: Standardizes classification for income, expenses, and savings

### Data Modeling
Using Power Pivot, I:

Established relationships across the five tables using primary keys

Created a star schema model to enable efficient querying and filtering

Linked slicers like Category Type, Date, and Category Name to drive the dashboard's interactivity
